Provide valid JSON output. The output data schema should be like this: {"decomposition": [{"text": "string", "start": number, "end": number, "body parts": list}, {"text": "string", "start": number, "end": number, "body parts": list}, ...]}
I want to break down an action into a predetermined set of known actions. You have been provided with a list of known actions in the file called "texts_train".

You will be sent sentences in English one by one that describe the movement of a person with the start and end second of the movement.
The goal is to explain the input movement as if it had never been seen before, describing it as a combination of known movements found in the "texts_train" file.
Respond ONLY by breaking down the input action using the verbs and actions present in the "texts_train" file.

In the file "gpt_example_stmc" there are some examples of decomposition. Use those as a reference.

YOU CANNOT USE MOVEMENT VERBS, ACTIONS, OR SPECIFIC NOUNS IF THEY ARE NOT IN THE FILE!

BREAK DOWN INTO SIMPLE SENTENCES, each focusing on a single body part, such as: "A person holds an object with his right hand." Avoid sentences composed of many clauses.

For each sub-movement you create, indicate its textual description "text", the start time "start", the end time "end", and the involved "body parts."

Use ONLY the following body parts: "legs", "right arm", "left arm", "spine" and "head". DO NOT USE ANY OTHER WORDS EXCEPT THESE body parts.

CONSTRAINT: two sub-movements cannot be performed simultaneously or have any temporal overlap if they involve the same "body parts." For example, the following is NOT ACCEPTABLE: {"decomposition": [{"text": "a person raises the left arm", "start": 0, "end": 5.2, "body parts": ["left arm"]}, {"text": "a person throws a left punch", "start": 3.5, "end": 8.1, "body parts": ["left arm"]}]} because there is an overlap of "left arm" for the two sub-movements from second 3.5 to 5.2.

CONSTRAINT: Ensure that there is no time interval that is not assigned to any sub-movement. For example, the following is NOT ACCEPTABLE: {"decomposition": [{"text": "a person raises the left arm", "start": 0, "end": 2.0, "body parts": ["left arm"]}, {"text": "a person throws a left punch", "start": 4, "end": 6.0, "body parts": ["left arm"]}]} because there is a time interval from second 2.0 to 4.0 that is not assigned to any sub-movement.

Do not use more than 4 sentences.
One or two sentences are fine too.

IF POSSIBLE DO NOT MAKE ANY ACTION LAST LESS THAN 2-3 SECONDS.

AT LEAST ONE OUTPUT ACTION MUST START FROM SECOND 0.
In each decomposition, the end second cannot be greater than the end second of the input.

In each decomposition, the start second must be strictly less than the end second.
