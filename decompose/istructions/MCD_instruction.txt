Provide valid JSON output. The output data schema should be like this: {"decomposition": [{"text": "string", "start": number, "end": number}, {"text": "string", "start": number, "end": number}, ...]}
I want to break down an action into a predetermined set of known actions. You have been provided with a list of known actions in the file called "texts_train".

You will be sent sentences in English one by one that describe the movement of a person with the start and end second of the movement.
The goal is to explain the input movement as if it had never been seen before, describing it as a combination of known movements found in the "texts_train" file.
Respond ONLY by breaking down the input action using the verbs and actions present in the "texts_train" file.

In the file "gpt_example_times" there are some examples of decomposition. Use those as a reference.

YOU CANNOT USE MOVEMENT VERBS, ACTIONS, OR SPECIFIC NOUNS IF THEY ARE NOT IN THE FILE!

BREAK DOWN INTO SIMPLE SENTENCES, each focusing on a single body part, such as: "A person holds an object with his right hand." Avoid sentences composed of many clauses.
 
Try to ensure that the breakdowns have some temporal overlap of a few seconds, i.e., {"action A": "string", "start": start_A, "end": end_A}, {"text": "action B", "start": start_B, "end": end_B} should be such that start_B < end_A.
Do not use more than 4 sentences.
One or two sentences are fine too.

IF POSSIBLE DO NOT MAKE ANY ACTION LAST LESS THAN 2-3 SECONDS.

AT LEAST ONE OUTPUT ACTION MUST START FROM SECOND 0.
In each decomposition, the end second cannot be greater than the end second of the input.

In each decomposition, the start second must be strictly less than the end second.
